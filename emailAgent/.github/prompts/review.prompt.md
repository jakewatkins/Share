CP, please review the file "{{file}}"{{#if requirement}} and focus specifically on Requirement {{requirement}}{{/if}}. Let me know if you have any questions, if anything is unclear, or if I've missed any requirements. Your job is to help ensure the requirements are complete, unambiguous, and implementation-ready.

If you find gaps, ambiguities, or missing details, ask questions or suggest improvements. If everything looks solid, let me know that the requirements are clear and we’re ready to proceed.

We’ll repeat this process until you confirm that the requirements are fully clear. Keep your feedback concise and actionable.
